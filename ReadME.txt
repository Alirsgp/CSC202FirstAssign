Steps to run UseMyBigDecimal:

1. Type java UseMyBigDecimal in terminal/DOS.

2. Enter your two numbers; if either inputs are incorrect, you must resubmit both numbers again. Inputs can be up to 100 digits, with one decimal (or not decimal) and numbers before and after the decimal.

3. Type 'Add' to add the two numbers or 'subtract' to subtract them. Casing does not matter, but invalid entries prompt you to exit the program. Run it again if you exit the program. 

4. The result will be displayed.
